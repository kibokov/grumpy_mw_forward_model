# grumpy_mw_forward_model

The jupyter notebooks in this repository contain the code to reproduce figures from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04511). The entire code is split into two notebooks. Part 1 primarily includes the code involving forward modeling the satellite population for comparison with observed samples in DES, PS1 etc. Part 2 includes code for the rest of the figures in the paper. The data to reproduce all these figures is available [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zmwh6wxyv3/1). Follow the below steps to reproduce the paper figures using the above jupyter notebooks.  


1. Download the data file from [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zmwh6wxyv3/1). Un-tar the file and note down the path of this folder/directory. 

2. Assign the path of this data folder to the variable ```data_path``` as done 

3. Run the notebooks cell-by-cell to produce the plots from the paper.
